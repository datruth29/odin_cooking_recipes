        <p>Everyone loves tomato sauce. While traditionally used with pasta, combining it with other bases can work just as well (rice, couscous, etc). And while tomato sauce by itself is great, every so often you'll want to add a little something extra to our good ol' sauce. Hence, meat sauce!</p>
        <p>To put it succintly, meat sauce is tomato sauce, but with the additional ingrediant of a type of meat. For this recipe we will be using ground beef. This can be found pretty readily at many markets. The juices and extra meatiness will add some extra weight and depth to the taste of our dish. Best of all, it can still be applied to all the other pasta dishes that we love.</p>

        <h2>Ingrediants</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
            <li>1 Vidalia Onion (Medium or Large)</li>
            <li>1 tbsp of Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
            <li>28oz can of Diced or Crushed Tomatoes</li>
            <li> A small can of tomato paste (or even better, tubed tomato paste)</li>
            <li>1 batch of Parsley</li>
            <li>1 batch of Basil</li>
            <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of water</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A small sauce pot (where we will be cooking our sauce)</li>
            <li>A pan (where we will be cooking the meat)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Dice up the garlic, onion, and parsley.</li>
            <li>In a small to medium sized sauce pot, heat up a tablespoon of olive oil on medium heat.</li>
            <li>Place the onion in the sauce pot for approximately 5 minutes (or until you the onion is slightly brown and gives off a fragance) </li>
            <li>Next, toss in the diced garlic. Let cook for about 1-2 minutes. You want the garlic to give off a fragance, but not turn brown.</li>
            <li>While this is happening, take a small amount of ground meat (say about a half a cups worth) and toss that in the pot.</li>
            <li>Let the meat cook on the pot for about 3-5 minutes. Mix it with the onions and garlic. Make sure it starts to breaks apart.</li>
            <li>While this is happening, put a separate pan on the stove and turn on the heat to medium-high.</li>
            <li>Place the reminder of the ground beef on the pan. Make sure to try to break it apart.</li>
            <li>Go back to the pot. Once the meat in the pot has been browned and is giving off a nice meaty smell, you will want to put in your can of diced tomatoes and about your tomato paste (put in about a tablespoon if you are using the tubed tomato paste, and about half a small can).</li>
            <li>Turn the pot to medium-high and stir.</li>
            <li>Pour in half a cup of water</li>
            <li>Place in diced parsley, and the whole basil.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Once you see the mixture bubbling, lower it to about medium heat and let simmer</li>
            <li>Check on your meat. Once fully cooked (it will be brown all over) place the meat into the pot.</li>
            <li>Let simmer for about 15-20 minutes. Check occasionally to taste. If you need to add salt and pepper do so.</li>
            <li>After 20 minutes the sauce should be reduced. If you want to add more thickness you can add more tomato paste. Let cook for longer if you want fuller tastes.</li>
            <li>Once cook, place in pasta or choice or store in freezer safe container and place in freezer. Will be good for approx. 1 month.</li>
        </ol>
