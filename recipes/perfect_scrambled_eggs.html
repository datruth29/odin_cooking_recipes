        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 Medium Eggs</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon of Butter</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Non-stick Pan</li>
            <li>Spatula</li>
            <li>Small Bowl</li>
            <li>Fork or Small Whisk</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Take out 3 eggs. Crack them and place the contents into a small bowl. Try not to get any egg shells into the bowl.</li>
            <li>Beat the eggs with a fork or small whisk. There should be no egg white bubbles when you are done.</li>
            <li>Once the eggs have been beaten enough, take a non-stick pan and place it on medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Take a tablespoon of butter and place it in the pan.</li>
            <li>As soon as it's melted, place in the eggs.</li>
            <li>While the egg is cooking, use the spatula to move the egg around the pan.</li>
            <li>Keep stirring the egg mix with he spatula as you are cooking. Every 30 seconds you will want to remove the pan from the heat, and then place back on the heat (while stirring mind you!) Do this for about 2-3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the eggs look like they are solidifying, put on some salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>You will want to take the eggs out while it's still a bit runny. This is because the heat from the eggs will finish the rest of the cooking (if you cook it all the way while on the pan, it will wind up overcooking. This isn't going to kill the dish though, just something to keep in mind).</li>
            <li>Once the egg has cooled down for about 1-2 minutes, place it on a plate.</li>
            <li>And you're done!</li>
        </ol>
