        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 teaspoons of dried yeast</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons of sugar</li>
            <li>1 - 1 1/3 cup of warm water 105℉</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of fine sea salt (alternatively, regular salt works as well)</li>
            <li>3 - 3 1/2 cups of all-purpose flower</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Mixing Bowl</li>
            <li>1 Loaf Bread Pan</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine yeast, water, and sugar into a bowl</li>
            <li>Stir until it is dissolved</li>
            <li>Combine salt, flour, and egg</li>
            <li>Mix until the dough is rougher</li>
            <li>Take out of the bowl until a lightly floured surface.</li>
            <li>Kneed the dough for about 4-5 minutes until the dough is much firmer. It should be able to maintain a shape (here is a youtube link <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySOj0fFWo1U" rel="external">showing how to kneed dough</a> for reference.) </li>
            <li>Shape it into a ball and place it into the bowl. Cover the bowl.</li>
            <li>Let the dough rise for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
            <li>Take the dough out of the bowl. Shape and place it into the pan.</li>
            <li>Let it sit in the pan for an additional hour (make sure to cover it.)</li>
            <li>While this is happening, preheat the oven to 425℉. Make sure to place the rack to the lowest section.</li>
            <li>Once the bread has finished resting, place it into the oven for 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>At the end of the 45 minutes, take it out the oven and let it sit for 15 - 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>You should now be able to cut the bread and consume!</li>
        </ol>
